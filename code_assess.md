### Merge Intervals
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input. 

Tests:
```
a)
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
b) 
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
c)
Input: [[0,0], [1,1]]
Output: [[0,0], [1,1]]
```

Constraints:
```
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104
starti is sorted
```
